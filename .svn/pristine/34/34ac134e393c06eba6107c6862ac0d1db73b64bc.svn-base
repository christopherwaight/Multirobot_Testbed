function [] = spacingMatrixParallel(datas,SimParams)
% uses data from either a single simulation or parallel simulations and
% calculates the lattice factor (lattice spacing between robobots). It then
% produces a weighted graph only including edges that are less than 1.25
% times the avoidance range. This is to visualize the "lattice structure"
% of the swarm
% Inputs: 
%   datas: an array of data output from the simulations 
%   SimParams: a struct containing information about the simulations
